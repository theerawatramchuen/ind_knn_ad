B. Building and Installing (Recommended for developers)
For this approach you need to install the GCC tools:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libtool autoconf unzip wget

B-1. Uninstall the default version provided by Ubuntu's package manager as in A-1.

sudo apt purge --auto-remove cmake

B-2. Go to the official CMake webpage, then download and extract the latest version. Update the version and build variables in the following command to get the desired version:

version=3.22
build=1
## don't modify from here
mkdir ~/temp
cd ~/temp
wget https://cmake.org/files/v$version/cmake-$version.$build.tar.gz
tar -xzvf cmake-$version.$build.tar.gz
cd cmake-$version.$build/

B-3. Install the extracted source by running:

./bootstrap
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install

B-4. Test your new cmake version.

$ cmake --version
Results of cmake --version:

cmake version 3.22.X

CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).
